has taken the maximum care of the students as well as the staff. We have got a medical center 
which facilitates most of the health services including clinical and dental facilities. 
We have developed a Medical Center Management System in order to improve its effectiveness 
and quality of work. This system includes registration of students and the staff, storing of their
